# Password Classification
This project was my first attempt at data analysis and was part of a cyber security internship for Civil Services.
To make things easier, I generated my own dataset apart from sourcing worst passwords from https://www.purevpn.com/blog/worst-password-list/.
I had two datasets - one with only good and bad passwords, the other with ranging strengths. The dataset with passwords with different strengths has been attached.
The presentation I gave after analysing the data has also been attached as well as the snippet of code which I used to generate passwords. Note - the password generation file was edited to give stronger and weaker passwords which is why there is only one file attached and not many.
