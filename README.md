# Password Classification

This project was my first attempt at data analysis and was part of a cyber security internship for Civil Services.
To make things easier, I generated my dataset apart from sourcing the worst passwords from https://www.purevpn.com/blog/worst-password-list/ as well as writing a snippet that makes stronger passwords.

I had two datasets - one with only good and bad passwords, the other with ranging strengths. The dataset with passwords with different strengths has been attached.

The presentation I gave after analysing the data has also been attached as well as the snippet of code which I used to generate passwords. 

The KNN algorithm file also contains a code snippet that combines the original password with a word given by the user to create a new stronger password so the user can remember the stronger password better.
